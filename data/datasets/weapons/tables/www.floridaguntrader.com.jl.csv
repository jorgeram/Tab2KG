These are all 100% copper plated applied electrochemically to a precision swaged lead core. So you won't come in contact with any dangerous lead while handling them and at the same time, they won't foul up and ruin your high-dollar actions and barrels. Safe for Glocks and similar barreled firearms. After electroplating, they're restruck to ensure precise diameters and consistency from bullet to bullet and lot to lot.   I've loaded and shot thousands of these so can personally report they are just as accurate as any Jacketed bullet. As you can see from the pics above, they are very nice projectiles and very shiny. Definitely a step up from your ""Berry's plated Bullets"" You'll be hard pressed to find a plated lead bullet such as this that is the weight it says on the box. Unlike Berry's that are always off by 5-10 grs. This makes a BIG difference when setting up your powder charge.
